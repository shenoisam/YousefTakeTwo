# YousefTakeTwo

This project simulates the popular card game YOUSEF in command line C++. It was created at HACKUTA in 
October 2017 mainly by Sam Shenoi, Peter Tran, and Chris. Two other people assisted on this project as well. 

IMPORTANT INFO ON GAMEPLAY: 
To play the game, launch the program on an IDE. The program will ask if you know how to play and teach you if you dont. 


Versions 1.1 BUGS:
In this version there is a bug when playing multiple cards. The program doesn't shrink your hand after playing multiple cards. 
This will be fixed eventually. SORRY!!

Additionally, the program cannot handle entering multiple indexes at one time. Please enter one index, hit enter, 
and then enter your successive indexes.  


ENJOY.
